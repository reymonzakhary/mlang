This package is a high-performance solution designed to provide efficient multi-language support for Laravel applications. It offers robust features and optimizations to ensure fast and reliable language management, making your application accessible to a global audience without sacrificing performance.

## Features

* [Accelerated translation retrieval](#Acceleratedtranslationretrieval): Translation strings are efficiently retrieved from the same database table, minimizing database join queries and improving response times.
* [Seamless integration with Laravel](#SeamlessintegrationwithLaravel): The package integrates seamlessly with Laravel, leveraging its existing localization infrastructure while providing performance enhancements.


* [Translation helpers](#Translationhelpers): You can use helper functions and methods to translate your application's content into different languages. These helpers make it easy to retrieve and display translated strings.
* [Language detection](#Languagedetection): The package includes automatic language detection based on the user's browser settings. It also supports manual language selection for users.
* [Language fallbacks](#Languagefallbacks): If a translation is missing for a specific language, the package supports fallbacks to default or alternative languages. This ensures that users always see content in a supported language.

#### Notice
This package will add two extra columns to the model you will use, row_id and iso.
The package will use the row_id as id, to grep the right row from the db. 

* [row_id](#row_id): This column will hold the main primary key for you on all languages. 
* [iso](#iso): This column holding the language key, e.g. en,nl,fr,etc... 
## Requirements

* PHP >= 8.2
* Laravel >= 10.0 

*** This package requires the following package. ***
```php
composer require doctrine/dbal
```

## Installation
1 - Install the package using Composer:
```php
composer require upon/mlang
```
2 - Publish the package configuration and language files:
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mlang"
```
3 - Configure the package by modifying the ``config/mlang.php`` file according to your requirements.

You can specify the supported locales, default locale, models, and other options.

4 - Configure in your mlang config file the needed model for translations. 

```php
// ...
'models' => [
    \App\Models\Category::class,
    \App\Models\Product::class,
    // ...
]
// ...
```

5- Replace the default extended Model with the `MlangModel`.

```php
<?php
// ...
use Upon\Mlang\Models\MlangModel;

class Category extends MlangModel
{
    // ...
```
6 - Run the migration command to migrate the new columns, to the added models.

```shell
    php artisan mlang:migrate
```



###Managing Translations to existing records
* To generate translations for existing rows, use the following command:
```php
php artisan mlang:generate
```
* To generate in a specific table, use the following command:
```php
/** Replace {model} with the desired model you need 
 * (e.g., category or in subdirectory dir\\Category).
 * This using the default model path [App\\Models]
 * you can update the model path in the config file.  
 */
php artisan mlang:generate {model}
```

* To generate a specific language code, use the following command:
```php
/** 
 * all to run all models or specify one model name (e.g., Sub\\Category).
 * Replace {locale} with the desired language code (e.g., en for English).
 */
php artisan mlang:generate {model|all} {locale}
```


* To delete a language from table, use the following command:
```php
/**
 * Replace {locale} with the desired language code (e.g., en for English).
 * Replace {table} with the desired table name (e.g., categories).  
 */
php artisan mlang:remove {table} {locale}
```

- The package includes automatic language detection based on the user's browser's language. It uses the Accept-Language header or browser settings to determine the preferred language.
    - <span style="color: #1589F0;">(Optional)</span> Add the locale middleware to your app/Http/Kernel.php file in the $middlewareGroups property:
      To detect the user browser language.

```php
 protected $middlewareGroups = [
'web' => [
// ...
\Upon\Mlang\Middleware\DetectUserLanguageMiddleware::class,
],

    // ...
];
```

To manually set the language for a user, you can use the setLocale() method:
```php
/** Replace {locale} with the desired language code. */
app()->setLocale('{locale}');
```

## Usage

To find a record from db by id, you can use the following. \
This will get the translated record based on the current language has been used by your application.
```php
    Model::trFind(1);
```
The trWhere method will work like the normal where but will map the `id` to `row_id` column to be able selecting the current language.
This will return a build,  so you can chain on it with other query.
```php
    /** This will get a collection based on the current language*/
    Model::trWhere(['name' => 'test'])->get();
```
